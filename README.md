## Prerequisites
- [Roblox Studio](https://www.roblox.com/create)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Rojo](https://rojo.space/)

## Setup
1. **Install Rojo in Roblox Studio**:
   - Open Roblox Studio and go to the Plugins tab.
   - Search for 'Rojo' in the plugin marketplace and install it.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**:
   - Open the cloned project directory in Visual Studio Code.
   - Ensure the Rojo extension is installed in Visual Studio Code.

4. **Start Rojo**:
   - Inside Visual Studio Code, open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type `Rojo: Start Server`. This will start the Rojo server.
   - Alternatively, you can start Rojo from the terminal by navigating to your project directory and running `rojo serve`.

5. **Connect Roblox Studio to Rojo**:
   - In Roblox Studio, click on the Rojo plugin to open it.
   - Click 'Connect' to link Roblox Studio with the Rojo server running in Visual Studio Code.
